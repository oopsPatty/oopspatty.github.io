        <p>In summer 2017, I had my internship at the design consultancy - Live Well Collaborative. It was a splendid time with understanding and growing-up. Working with incredible and talented people, meeting collaborators of totally different backgrounds, I had a pleasure of learning, designing and crafting experience in a very complicated world. I worked with two distinctive client groups and was in charge of two projects — they were extremely different —</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One was working with a local senior living facility, to redesign the emergency exit door context for residents with dementia there, which is a system design project, mostly on the basis of design thinking, and finally we came out a comprehensive and systematic solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other one was serving Cincinnati Children's Hospital for two tasks — devising a new Oncology Handbook and releasing the 1-2-3 initiative device. This project led me into printing world together with elevating my practical engineering skills, which I developed in my undergraduate time, to create a real objective for real needs. It can be said that these tasks were bitter-sweet challenges and affirmation for my all-round ability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
