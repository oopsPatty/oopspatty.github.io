              <p>As a leading service provider of urban rail transit in China, the Beijing Mass Transit Railway (Aka BJ-MTR) looks for new approaches that would make the operation task management more agile, creative and innovative in their digital transformation. Thus, BJ-MTR selected Accenture Greater China to rapidly innovate disruptive and digital services on task management for front-stage staff using Design Thinking and a lean start-up approach.</p>

<p>Accenture is helping BJ-MTR build the relevant knowledge, skill set, and organizational structure to ideate, develop, and implement customer-relevant <strong>minimum lovable product</strong> in a short timeframe — or fail fast.<br>
<br></p>
<h1 id="chapter-1-understand-our-people-interviewworkshop">Chapter 1. Understand our people (Interview+Workshop)</h1>
<p><strong>If you want to make digital transformation, you have to know what to motivate.</strong></p>
<p>No matter an enterprise product or a consumer product, the behaviors of the end-users are the foremost to be understood. In this circumstance, the front-stage working staff are the ones we need to empathize.</p>
<p>And of course, knowing better about the biz workflow. Accenture team conducted the interviews with different roles for the different workflows, for better understanding the people’s needs and motivations, and the business process As-Is as well.<br>
<img src="https://oopspatty.github.io/post-images/1579421393861.JPG" alt="BJ-mtr-workshop-1" loading="lazy"><br>
After getting first-hand information, Accenture organized a two-day Design Thinking Workshop, which involved the BJ-MTR people from Managing, Operation, IT and front-stage crew and the designers, scrum masters and tech experts from Accenture,  analyzing the pain-point, biz requirements, human needs, while potential technical innovation opportunities.<br>

<h1 id="chapter-2-get-your-hands-dirty-shadowing">Chapter 2. Get your hands dirty (shadowing)</h1>
<p><img src="https://oopspatty.github.io/post-images/1579420079442.jpeg" alt="BJ-mtr-shadowing-1" loading="lazy"><br>
For defining the clear opportunities of digitalization, designers from ACN delivered a shadowing research to put themselves into staff’s shoes - observing and following their daily working routes, recording the difficulties and pain-points, collecting the measurement criteria for current business workflows, which are the basis of orientation to build a new digital platform.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-3-play-to-consolidate-responsibly-prototyping-test">Chapter 3. Play to consolidate, responsibly (Prototyping &amp; Test)</h1>
<p>We followed Agile to make quick progress. However, the end of design is not to make a beautiful interface, the optimization of a business process is not the destination of a project. Consolidation in a responsible way is an alchemy stone to make a trial of an assumption is feasible, desirable and achieve goal or not.<br>
<img src="https://oopspatty.github.io/post-images/1579420517895.PNG" alt="BJ-mtr-test-1" loading="lazy"><br>
In order to better simulate the prototype in an assumed scenarios, the ACN team invited different staff to carry out interface evaluation on the paper prototype for their own roles in the task. We also made clickable interactive prototype for the end users to experience. During the experience prototype, the Think-Out-Loud approach allowed them to express their opinions, while these voices encouraged each other to speak out and inspired the design team as well.<br>

<h1 id="chapter-4-the-outcome">Chapter 4. The outcome</h1>
<p>The people involved initiated innovation change for BJ-MTR staff that allowed them to understand and learn how to innovate in a design-thinking-led way. Accenture team also created a framework for a repeatable innovation practice at BJ-MTR over the 3 courses of 2-week sprints - Stay agile and continuously iteration, while scene expansion and data accumulation.</p>
<p>Another outcome was design doing. Accenture design team delivered a tangible product with transparency in information and processes, trust across departments,  efficiency and pleasure brought by digital convenience. Tangible items delivered to BJ-MTR include a report of user experience evaluation, demos for different roles and workflow, a high-fidelity interactive prototype based on the selected workflows.<br>

<h1 id="chapter-x-continuous-going">Chapter X. Continuous Going</h1>
<p>The minimum lovable service, moved forward with Digital Product Creation for task management, into the Deliver phases. There, Accenture’s delivery team will involve and start to architect through the prioritized product backlog to develop the system services. This will be followed by a release pilot.</p>
