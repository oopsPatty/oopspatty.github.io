<h1 id="insiders-vs-outsiders">INSIDERS vs OUTSIDERS</h1>
<p>During my journey of research, people can be generally categorized as two groups based on that if they have the experience and prior knowledge about Alzheimer's disease or not.<br>
<strong>Alzheimer's Insiders</strong> - People who have/had relatives with Alzheimer's.<br>
<strong>Alzheimer's Outsiders</strong> - People who might not have a relative with Alzheimer's YET.<br>
<br><br>
There is, however, no actual boundary between two groups of people, for instance, an individual who recently find his/her family member showing symptoms of Alzheimer's or the senior loved ones who are lately diagnosed with Alzheimer's. And, the voice from the insiders can reliably guide the outsiders to know better about the disease even what next steps to leap as long as it occurs.</p>

<p>Based on the research findings, information architecture, wireframes, user flow and storyboard for the whole digital experience followed.<br>
<br><br>
Two digital experience — mobile application for communication and service searching &amp; website for knowledge promotion — are proposed to boost the public awareness on Alzheimer’s disease and minimize the societal-isolation that caused by the disease.<br>

<p>The mobile application is designed to increase the accessibility of information about Alzheimer's disease to eliminate the social isolation.<br>
<br><br>
It is a user backend to connect the people who are already/potentially affected by the Alzheimer's, like the families, professionals, volunteers, etc. With this approach, all the communities can reach the authentic stories and experience about the Alzheimer's. Meanwhile, the users can easily locate, engage and manage related campaigns and service to support themselves when necessary.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Stories, functioning as the catalyst to open the heart of both Alzheimer's affected persons and Alzheimer's-resisted groups, can also prompt the elimination of social isolations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication on the platform increase the efficiency of information accessibility, expand the networking and introduce more possibilities to problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bringing the resources of related campaigns, organization and services to satisfy the offline needs.</p>

<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>My original intention is to design a simply communicative platform to solve the understanding issue for the people who are both affected by the disease and the non-sufferers, particularly for Chinese communities - most of who know little about it - and both groups are socially separated by the disease. That the StoryPot app came to my mind to resolve the severity of misunderstanding and miscommunication. As my research went deeper, however, I found the psychological rejection and lack of understanding prohibit the public to access to the disease-related information. Further as I researched, how to catch the public's attention to the disease is also as crucial as a prerequisite for those people who know little about the disease. Thus, here comes the idea of StoryPot.org.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Improving the lives of people who are affected by the Alzheimer's disease is a life-long task. To prepare for the future in advance with generations and generations bonding is the key to end it.</p>
<h1 id="follow-up">FOLLOW UP</h1>
<p>In terms of time limitation and explosion of existing social networking, the StoryPot App is looking for a better way to launch. However, the great news is, the clinicians (who I interviewed during the research stage) and I built a temporary chatting group on the most popular SNS in China. Until April 2018, 78 persons (including young individuals and family members) have been in this group and share all the info about Alzheimer's from time to time, of course there are much more opportunities to propagandize disease-related events. Another notable news is, the StoryPot.org is on the list of construction.</p>
